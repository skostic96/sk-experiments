# My personal experiments

This repository is collection of random experiments.

## Motivation for this repository

Three years ago I started building habit to experiment random ideas. Sometimes I get urge to try something, but it just gets lost. The solution was to have a repository that will contain these small samples.

On a side note, a lot of my work is abandoned and never completed. A lot of useful ideas I tried are lost. I have really big folder on computer, over 3gb (thank you node modules).

However, this folder has tens of ideas on which I've spent months working.

And lastly, this repository is also motivation to publish every sample of interesting work I do.

## Navigation instructions

Each sample is placed in its own directory.

Each of them has `README` file explaining what is it about and what does it do.

It probably also contains reason I decided to try it out.
