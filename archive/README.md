# Archived samples

Project `multiple-projects-demo` is archived because that idea illustrates monorepos.

However, monorepos work differently, they really are one repository. Directory `multiple-projects-demo` has two projects and each of them has its own node_modules, which isn't pretty solution.

Monorepo solves this problem in much better way, which I did not know at that time.
